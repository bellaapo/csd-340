Chapter 2 - Creating a Page
</h2>

<p class="intro">Hello, my name is Bella and I was born in San Diego, California. I grew up enjoying playing online games with my brother and sisters. My favorite game as a kid was Club Penguin, which I still play. My online presence was formative for my interest in computers, making it an immense passion of mine.</p>
<p>I have three sisters and a brother. My siblings and I are all fairly close and have all moved to Orlando, Florida. It's been so fulfilling watching my siblings grow up over the years.</p>
<p>I've only had jobs within the Walt Disney Company working in Food and Beverage. I have worked in EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, and Typhoon Lagoon. <span class="sentence">I recently just transferred back into EPCOT, where I am working in their biggest restaurant that has a capacity for 1,700 guests!</span></p>
<p>I am super passionate about environmental protection. Before switching my majors, I originally wanted to major in earth science and sustainability! I realized I was greatly limiting my opportunities and changed majors. Though, I still hope I can do something in that field.</p>
